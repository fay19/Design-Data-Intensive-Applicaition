# Batch Processing

## MapReduce
 -Mapper
   - The mapper is called once for every input record, and its job is to extract the key and value from the input record. For each input, it may generate any number of key-value pairs (including none). It does not keep any state from one input record to the next, so each record is handled independently.
 - Reducer
  - The MapReduce framework takes the key-value pairs produced by the mappers, collects all the values belonging to the same key, and calls the reducer with an iterator over that collection of values. The reducer can produce output records (such as the number of occurrences of the same URL)
  
### MapReduce Workflow
- Chain up multiple mapreduce job implicity by HDFS directory
